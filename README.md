## Description of Project ##

This project extends a tiny web server in Python. It is designed to work in user mode and thus uses a port > 1000.
The server can be started and stopped using the provided Makefile. The server only serves .html and .css files located in the DOCROOT.
The DOCROOT and ports can be configured in the config files or in the credentials file on your local machine.
